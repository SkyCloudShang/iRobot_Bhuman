/**

 * The file declares a struct BHULKsStandardMessage.
 * This message is intended to be used in between the SPLStandardMessage and the team's
 * private additional data.
 * The BHULKsStandardMessage is designed for the RoboCup SPL Mixed-Teams Competition 2017,
 * to specify the communication between the robots of team HULKs and the ones of team
 * B-Human that are building the Mixed-Team "B-Hulks".
 * In fact all data that is needed for an "inter team communication" must be declared
 * here, if it is not part of the SPLStandardMessage.

   Important remarks about units:

   For each parameter, the respective comments describe its unit.
   The following units are used:

     - Distances:  Millimeters (mm)
     - Angles:     Radian
     - Time:       Milliseconds (ms)
     - Speed:      Millimeters per second (mm/s)
     - Timestamp:  Milliseconds since system / software start (ms)
   */

  /*
    Important remarks about streaming sizes:
    NOT all values are streamed as a whole!
    If a unit is not streamed in its natural range, a commentary will indicate
    the range as it is interpreted.
    The general comment pattern is "[rangeFrom..rangeTo (in precision)]".

    E.g.
     uint32_t value0;    //-- no comment     (This will be streamed as full 4 Byte)
     bool     value1;    //-- no comment     (This may be streamed as 1 Bit)
     uint32_t value2;    // < [3..12]        (This will be streamed with minumum value 3
                                                                   and maximum value 12)
     uint16_t value3;    // < [3..12] bla    (Same as above)
     uint32_t value2;    // < [4..10 (2)]    (This will be streamed with a precision of 2, a minumum
                                               value of 4 and a maximum value of 10.
                                               This means after streaming it can hold 2,4,6,8 and 10)
     uint32_t time1      // < [delta 0..-10] (This will be streamed in relation to the timestamp of
                                               the message in range of 0 to -10.)
