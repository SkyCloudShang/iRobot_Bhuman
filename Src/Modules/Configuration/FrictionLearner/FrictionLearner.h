/**
 * @file FrictionLearner.h
 *
 * This file declares another module that estimates the ball friction coefficient.
 *
 * @author Tim Laue
 * @author Felix Wenk
 *
 * This module is intended to learn the ball friction coefficient. It assumes a linear model
 * for ball deceleration:
 *
 *   s = v * t + 0.5 * a * t^2  with v = ball velocity, a = ballFriction, s = rolled distance
 *
 * You can use this module as follows.
 * 1. Start it: mr DummyRepresentation FrictionLearner
 * 2. Roll the ball once through the robot's field of view
 *    - start and end point do not matter, but starting and ending outside the field of view *might* be better
 *    - avoid collisions as well as places on the field that are not completely even
 * 3. Read the messages that are printed on the console ;-)
 * 4. Repeat 2. + 3. multiple times and filter out the outliers by yourself ;-)
